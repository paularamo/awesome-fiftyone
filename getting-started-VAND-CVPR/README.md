# ðŸš€ Getting Started with MVTec AD 2 â€“ VAND 2025 CVPR Challenge

Welcome to the official starter notebook and resources for the **Visual Anomaly and Novelty Detection (VAND) 2025 Challenge** at CVPR!

This repository is designed to help participants get up and running with the **MVTec AD 2** dataset using the [FiftyOne](https://voxel51.com/fiftyone) platform for dataset management, visualization, and evaluation. Whether you're an academic researcher or an industry practitioner, this challenge is your chance to contribute to the next generation of AI models for real-world anomaly detection.

## About the VAND 2025 Challenge

Hosted at **CVPR 2025**, the VAND Challenge is an initiative to push the boundaries of visual anomaly detection. Sponsored by **Voxel51**, **Intel**, and **MVTec**, this challenge brings together the best minds in computer vision to address real industrial use cases using modern techniques like **few-shot learning**, **Vision-Language Models (VLMs)**, and **robust feature extraction**.

## Challenge Tracks

### Track 1: Adapt & Detect
Work with the newly released **MVTec AD 2** dataset featuring 8 object categories and multiple distribution shifts (e.g., lighting changes). Develop models that are **robust**, **adaptive**, and can detect **previously unseen anomalies** in challenging real-world conditions.

### Track 2: VLM Anomaly Challenge
Use the **MVTec LOCO AD** dataset to tackle logical and structural anomalies. This track encourages the use of **Vision-Language Models** and **few-shot techniques** to identify defects with minimal examples.
